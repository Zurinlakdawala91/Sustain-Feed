From Expiry to Empathy: Transforming food waste into solutions for hunger challenge.

# The Problem it Solves
"Our solution addresses the dual challenge of food wastage in supermarkets and human hunger by leveraging predictive analytics and proactive intervention. By analyzing two months' worth of sales data, remaining quantities, and expiry dates of supermarket items, our innovative approach predicts which products are nearing expiration within five days. This enables us to negotiate with stores to acquire these soon-to-be-wasted items at a significantly reduced cost, rescuing them from disposal. We then utilize cold storage facilities to preserve these perishables before distributing them to communities in need, effectively bridging the gap between surplus food and hunger relief efforts. Our initiative not only tackles food waste but also addresses food insecurity, offering a sustainable solution that benefits both businesses and vulnerable populations."

We have gathered data about the 3 month sales of every item in a supermarket, their quantity  remaining and their expiry date. We will predict the sales of the items about to be expired in 5 days or less. We will recommended the store to keep that quantity and sell us rest of the items at a very low cost. Then we would store these products (which would be expiring in 3 -5 days) in a cold storage unit or a cold storage food truck and transport it to the people in need and the areas where food is not available.
